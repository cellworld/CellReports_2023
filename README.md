# About The Repository

Welcome to the CellWorld System Git repository! This repository serves as the main hub for the CellWorld System, which relies on several external submodules. These submodules contain essential software required for the operation of the CellWorld System. 

## Related Work

The code in this repository is directly related to the methods presented in our research paper titled "A robot-rodent interaction arena with adjustable spatial complexity for ethologically relevant behavioral studies". Here, you'll find the definitive version of all the software essential for operating the system, along with the experimental data presented in this research paper. 

### Supplementary Videos

The supplementary videos referenced in our paper "A robot-rodent interaction arena with adjustable spatial complexity for ethologically relevant behavioral studies" provide a comprehensive demonstration of key aspects of the system. For example, these videos showcase results from a behavior task that leverages the system.
