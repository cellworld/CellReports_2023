# About The Project

Welcome to the CellWorld System Git repository! This repository serves as the main hub for the CellWorld System, which relies on several external submodules. These submodules contain essential software required for the seamless operation of the CellWorld System.

## Introduction

The code in this repository is directly related to the methods presented in our research paper titled "A robot-rodent interaction arena with adjustable spatial complexity for ethologically relevant behavioral studies".

## Supplementary Videos

The supplementary videos referenced in the paper "A Robot-Rodent Interaction Arena with Adjustable Spatial Complexity for Ethologically Relevant Behavioral Studies" provide a comprehensive demonstration of key aspects of the system. For example, these videos showcase results from a behavior task that leverages the intricate features of our system.
